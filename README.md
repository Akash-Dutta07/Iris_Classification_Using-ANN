The Iris Classification dataset is a classic benchmark in machine learning, commonly used for practicing classification algorithms. It contains detailed measurements of iris flowers, including sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, with the flower species serving as the target variable.















## **ðŸ“„Description**


ðŸ“‹ Column Descriptions:

- Sepal Length (cm): Length of the sepal in centimeters.

- Sepal Width (cm): Width of the sepal in centimeters.

- Petal Length (cm): Length of the petal in centimeters.

- Petal Width (cm): Width of the petal in centimeters.

- Species: The type of iris flower (Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica) to be predicted.

This dataset is ideal for applying classification techniques and practicing data visualization and analysis methods.


For model building, we applied Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), and Logistic Regression (LR).
Additionally, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was trained using a copy of the original dataset (df2) to explore deep learning approaches.

This dataset is ideal for applying classification techniques, model evaluation, and practicing data visualization and analysis methods.

## **ðŸ“‹Conclusion**

Multiple models were applied to the Iris Classification dataset. Support Vector Machine (SVM) achieved the highest accuracy at 96.67%, followed by Logistic Regression (LR) with 93.33%, and Decision Tree (DT) with 90.00%.
An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was also trained on a copy of the dataset (df2) and achieved an accuracy of 93.33%, matching the performance of Logistic Regression.
Overall, SVM performed the best among all models, while ANN demonstrated competitive results comparable to traditional machine learning algorithms.
